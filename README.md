# z-form-base - This is a learning exercise to build a secure form based off my z-base project. 

This project demonstrates the following:

Web Security: Helmet > CSP, Protection against XSS
Marketing: SEO, Social Media Optimized > Sitemap, Robots.txt
PageSpeed: Compression Enabled, Caching Enabled, HTACCESS
FrontEnd: Using SASS
BackEnd: Gulp > Compile Sass, Minify all JS into one file, Minify all compiled sass into one file
Using JQuery
Using VueJS
Captures data from form fields and posts to a results page
Uses VeeValidate for client side validation

Todo: UK telephone regex
Todo: Prevent Submit if client side validation hasn't passed yet
Todo: Server side validation
Todo: Make a request for data to an API
Todo: Make a request for data from an API I have created myself
Todo: Pass data back and forward using XML at least once
Todo: Further security e.g. CSRF Tokens

Todo but maybe in another project: Database connection with protection against SQL Injection
Todo but maybe in another project: Login functionality with secure password(hash/salt/encrypt) / Permissions
